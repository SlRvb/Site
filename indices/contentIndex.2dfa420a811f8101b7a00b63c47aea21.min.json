that I wanted to track which now are the folders you see in the screenshot above.\n\nThe reason the folders are separated is just *for me* to easily search through the folders to find which kind of

that.\n\nFolder | Description of Log |\n---|---|\n`0 BuJo` | MOCs for all the journal entry types.\n`1 Journal` | Events on that day.\n`2 Dream Journal` | Events in my dreams.\n`3 Workout Log` |

My old system just had the date then a title, but when listing or searching through them it was hard to tell what kind I was looking at. So I came up with this:\n\n**File Title Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-JT-ST - Title`\n- `JT` being the initials for the `Journal Type`\n- `ST` being intials for the `subtype` of the Journal Type\n\nInitials | Type |\n:---:|:---|\n`J` | Journal Day\n`DJ` | Dream Journal\n`WL` | Workout Log\n`WL-A` | Workout Log Arm Day\n`WL-T` | Workout Log Torso Day\n`WL-L` | Workout Log Lower Body Day\n`CD` | Code Diary\n`UL` | Update Log\n`R` | Resonance Calendar\n`CL` | Conditions Log\n\n**Examples:** \n- `2021-07-24-J - Community Showcase`\n- `2021-07-27-DJ - The Dream`\n- `2021-06-19-WL-L - New Leg Routine`\n\n## 1 Journal\n\n### Daily Journal Entry\nMy journal entries for daily notes are often very bare bones, because if I tried to record too much in/about a day I would *never* write anything. It's been a struggle to find out what it would take to get me to write regularly, but I think this template/setup is the closest I can get to nearly daily writing.\n\n---\nThe **File Title** often is a couple words about each important event that day; sometimes it's only 1 event and sometimes it's 3+. If there's more than 1, I'll just add a `+` plus sign between the titles to help me see the separation. \n**Example**: `2021-05-11-J - Dying Internet + CSV to MD Fixes`\n\n```md\n---\ntags: Journal/Date/Day\n\nDate: \u003c% tp.file.title.split(\"-J \")[0] %\u003e\nTitle: \u003c% tp.file.title.split(\" - \")[1] %\u003e\n---\n\u003ci\u003e**[[Journal]]**, [[Day]]\u003c/i\u003e\n\n# \u003c% moment(tp.file.title.split(\"-J\")[0]).format(\"dddd DD, MMMM YYYY\") %\u003e\n**Year**:: [[\u003c% moment(tp.file.title.split(\"-J\")[0]).format(\"YYYY\") %\u003e]]\n**Month**:: [[\u003c% moment(tp.file.title.split(\"-J\")[0]).format(\"YYYY-MM\") %\u003e]]\n**Rating**:: [[Rating]]\n**Tags**:: \n\n---\n# Summary\n- \u003c% tp.file.cursor(2) %\u003e\n\n---\n\n## Event Title\n- Event\n\n```\n\nThe **Summary section** is to finally get me to at least put a brief version of the important events that happened that day.\n\nThe **Event Title** headings after that are for more indepth recounts of the events of that day if it's really notable for me. Everything else regarding the actual events is written in bullet points because I do not want to write more than I have to and bullets are just far easier for me to reread.\n\n### Yearly Journal Entry\nThe yearly journal entry note is also bare bones as well, if not moreso. \n\nThe **File Title** is just the year number (ie. `2021`).\n\n````md\n---\ntags: Journal/Date/Year\n\nDate: \u003c% tp.file.title %\u003e\n---\n\u003ci\u003e[[Journal]], [[Year]]\u003c/i\u003e\n\n# \u003c% tp.file.title %\u003e\n**Rating**::\n**Tags**::\n\n---\n\n# Theme: \n- [ ] \n\n\n---\n# Reflections\n- \n\n---\n# Entries\n```dataview\nLIST \nFROM \"10 BuJo\"\nWHERE contains(file.name, \"\u003c% tp.file.title %\u003e-\")\nSORT file.name desc\n```\n````\n\nInspired by the video: [**Your Theme** by CGP Grey](https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE), I have a section for what my theme is for the year. Under that heading is just a place for some task that I might want to accomplish, but sometimes I just delete that and go straight for the reflections.\n\n**Reflections** are something that I fill out throughout the year, because I definitely won't remember nor will I want to sit down at the end of the year and try to remember everything that occurred. By the end of the year I want to *read* what I accomplished.\n\nThe **Entries** section is just a large list of all the files with the year that matches the current notes year.\n\n## 2 Dream Journal\nThe dream note is far more free form and actually written in paragraphs. Most of the time it's often done *right* when I wake up if I can remember the dream.\n\n```md\n---\ntags: Journal/Dream\n\nDate: \u003c% tp.file.title.split(\"-DJ\")[0] %\u003e\nTitle: \u003c% tp.file.title.split(\" - \")[1] %\u003e\n---\n\u003ci\u003e**[[Dream Journal]]**, [[Journal]]\u003c/i\u003e\n\n# \u003c% moment(tp.file.title.split(\"-DJ\")[0]).format(\"dddd DD, MMMM YYYY\") %\u003e\n**Year**:: [[\u003c% moment(tp.file.title.split(\"-DJ\")[0]).format(\"YYYY\") %\u003e]]\n**Month**:: [[\u003c% moment(tp.file.title.split(\"-DJ\")[0]).format(\"YYYY-MM\") %\u003e]], \u003c% tp.date.now(\"MMMM\") %\u003e\n**Tags**::\n**Fandom**:: \n**People**:: \n\n---\n# Event Of Dream\n\n```\n\n[![|sban](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_Dream-Journal-Page.png)](0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_Dream-Journal-Page.png)\n\n## 3 Workout Log\n\u003e The workout log is where I record my reps of my workout routine to measure my progress.\n\nThe workout log isn‚Äôt anything fancy, I just have a Form section on the table where I note how I felt for that particular exercise. Since there are a *couple* of templates for this part of the journal, I‚Äôll show the results first so you understand what all these pages end up looking like since they‚Äôre all the same.\n\n[![|sban](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_Workout-Log-Page.png)](0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_Workout-Log-Page.png)\n\n**Arm Day Template**\n````md\n---\ntags: Journal/Workout/Arms\ncssclass: table, t-c, writing\n---\n%%\nDate:: \u003c% tp.file.title.split(/-WL-/)[0] %\u003e\nYear:: [[\u003c% moment(tp.file.title.split(/-WL-/)[0]).format(\"YYYY\") %\u003e]]\nMonth:: [[\u003c% moment(tp.file.title.split(/-WL-/)[0]).format(\"YYYY-MM\") %\u003e]]\n\nWorkout:: [[Intense 5 Min Workouts -- Anabolic Aliens#Arms]]\nArea:: Arms\nWeight:: \nIntensity::\n\nTitle::\u003c% tp.file.title.split(\" - \")[1] %\u003e\nNotes:: \n%%\n\n\u003ci\u003e**[[Workout]]: ` dv= this.Area`**, [[Journal]]\n` dv= this.Workout`\n\u003c/i\u003e\n\n# \u003c% moment(tp.file.title.split(/-WL-/)[0]).format(\"dddd DD, MMMM YYYY\") %\u003e\n\u003e ` dv= this.Notes`\n\nExercise | Time | Log |\n---------|:----:|-----|\n**TRICEPS**||\n[[Overhead Extension]] | 1 Min |\n[[1-Arm Landmine Extension]] | L: 30 sec\u003cbr\u003eR: 30 sec |\n[[1-Arm Landmine Kickback]] |  L: 30 sec\u003cbr\u003eR: 30 sec |\n[[Skullcrushers]] | 1 Min |\n[[Close-Grip Bench Press]] | 1 Min | \n||\n**BICEPS** ||\n[[Bicep Curl]]| 1 Min |\n[[Reverse Curl]]| 1 Min |\n[[Drag Curl]]| 1 Min |\n[[Cross Arm Landmine Curl]]| L: 30 sec\u003cbr\u003eR: 30 sec |\n[[Concetration Landmine Curl]]| L: 30 sec\u003cbr\u003eR: 30 sec |\n||\n**FOREARMS**||\n[[Reverse Wrist Curl]] | 1 Min |\n[[Rotated Wrist Curl]] | 1 Min |\n[[Foreward Roll]] | 1 Min |\n[[Reverse Roll]] | 1 Min |\n[[Landmine Swing Backs]] | L: 30 sec\u003cbr\u003eR: 30 sec |\n\n## Vids\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R4xRByps7nY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

It used to be a lot random notes with 0 structure to them, but I finally came up with fields that I actually can fill out that are very helpful.

The video breaks down why to use and what goes into a code diary far more than I will, so do watch the video if you're interested.\n\nFor my personal Code Diary so far, I mostly write down code that, through trial and error, I came up with that does a particular thing that may be useful to know why it was done or just *what* it does.\n\n**Template:**\n````md\n---\ntags: Journal/Code-Diary\n\nDate: \u003c% tp.file.title.split(\"-CD\")[0] %\u003e\nTitle: \u003c% tp.file.title.split(\" - \")[1] %\u003e\n---\n\u003ci\u003e**[[Code Diary]]**, [[Journal]]\n[[Coding-\u003c% tp.file.cursor(1) %\u003e|\u003c% tp.file.cursor(2) %\u003e]], [[Program-\u003c% tp.file.cursor(3) %\u003e|\u003c% tp.file.cursor(4) %\u003e]]\n\u003c/i\u003e\n\n# Code\n```\u003c% tp.file.cursor(5) %\u003e\n```\n\n# Explanation\n- \u003c% tp.file.cursor(6) %\u003e\n\n# Result\n\n````\n\n**Result:**\n[![|sban](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_Code-Diary-Page.png)](0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_Code-Diary-Page.png)\n\n## 6 Resonance Calendar\n\u003e I was inspired by this video [**How I use Notion as a Resonance Calendar** by Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYBB-Uw1IM), watch through the video for a more indepth look at what a Resonance Calendar is.\n\nThe resonance calendar is a journal entry about a work that challenges the way I think or provides new insights. \n\n\nThe **File Title** format: `YYYY-MM-DD-R - Title -- Creator`.\nThe double dashes to me signify that it's a work with a creator that isn't me. Anything that comes after `--` tells me *that's* the creator. Usually I would have these flipped, but the work title is slightly more important to me to see first.\n\n**Template:**\n```md\n---\ntags: Journal/Resonance\ncssclass: hcl\nDate: \u003c% tp.file.title.split(\"-R\")[0] %\u003e\n---\n%%\nTitle:: \u003c% tp.file.title.split(\" - \")[1].replace(/ --.\\*/, '') %\u003e\nCreator:: \u003c% tp.file.title.split(\" -- \")[1] %\u003e\nSource:: \u003c% tp.file.cursor(1) %\u003e\nMedia:: [[Medium]]\n%%\n\u003ci\u003e**[[Resonance Calendar]]**\u003c/i\u003e\n\n# \u003c% tp.file.title.split(\"-R\")[1].replace(/ --.*/, '') %\u003e\n\u003ci\u003e`dv= this.Source`\u003c/i\u003e\n\n\u003ciframe width=100% height=300px src=\"\u003c% tp.file.cursor(2) %\u003e\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n# Notes\n\u003c% tp.file.cursor(3) %\u003e\n```\n\nThe page has some **metadata** about the work that I want to know:\n- The **Date** when I decided to add it to the journal\n- Who the **Creator** of that work is\n- The **Source**/where I found it\n- What type of **Media** it is (ie. Video, Podcast, Article, Book, etc)\n\nThen I'll embed that source if I can, otherwise I'll just delete the `iframe` and continue onto my notes.\n\nThe notes aren't anything special, this is still a fairly new setup for me, so it's just bullet points on things I found interesting or profound from the work.\n\nIf I haven't finished taking notes on the video I'll just randomly throw in a tag so that it looks ugly and bothers me so I *have* to go through the video to get rid of it. Which is nice because I can have my mind blown all over again.\n\n**Result:**\n[![|sban](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_Resonance-Calendar-Page.png)](0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_Resonance-Calendar-Page.png)\n\n## 7 Update Log\n\u003e The **Update Log** is where I list out the things I've changed between creation or the last update of a project.\n\nI keep the update log's page very simple as it's just the bare bones outline of the updates I've added. For now, the only project that I have that I need updates for is the [**ITS Theme**](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/theme-its-dark-light-theme).\n\nThe title and date are usually left blank until I feel I've done enough to finally push an update through. *Then*, I'll add the information manually to all of it. The only thing that's updated first is the Project wikilink.\n\n---\nThe **File Title** will be formatted `YYYY-MM-DD-UL-PI - Updates`.\n`PI` is the project initials that I decide on, usually about 2-5 letters depending on the title. **For example**, for the ITS Theme updates the file title is:\n\n`2021-07-31-UL-ITS - Icon \u0026 Image Adjustment \u0026 Updates + Kanban Adjustments`\n\n**Template:**\n```md\n---\ntags: Journal/Update-Log\n\nDate: \nTitle: \n---\n\u003ci\u003e**[[Update Log]]**\n**Project**:: [[]]\n**Link**:: []()\n\u003c/i\u003e\n\n# ` dv= this.Date` - ` dv= this.Project`\n- Updates/Fixes\n```\n\n**Result:**\n[![|sban](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_Update-Log-Page.png)](0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_Update-Log-Page.png)\n\n\n# QuickAdd\n\u003e The QuickAdd plugin allows me to easily select whichever type of journal entry I want to create and enter the information I need.\n\n[![|sban](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_QuickAdd-Prompt.png)](0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-Journal_QuickAdd-Prompt.png)\n\nMy setup here is *very* simple, just a template with some stuff in the file name and folder  input and toggled on `Open` to open to the note once it's created.\n\n\u003e **For simplicity:**\n\u003e `1` is the **File Name Format**\n\u003e `2` is the **Folder Format**\n\n---\n**Bullet Journal** ‚Äï Template\n1.  `{{DATE:YYYY}}/{{DATE}}-J - {{VALUE:Title}}.md`\n2. `10 BuJo/1 Journal`\n\n---\n**Dream Journal** ‚Äï Template\n1. `{{DATE:YYYY}}/{{DATE}}-DJ - {{VALUE:Title}}.md`\n2. `10 BuJo/2 Dream Journal`\n\n---\n**Workout Log** ‚Äï Template\n1. `{{DATE:YYYY}}/{{DATE}}-WL-{{VALUE:A,T,L,W}} - .md`\n2. `10 BuJo/2 Dream Journal`\n\nThe template for this is different since I have different options I need to chose from. The letters are mostly the same choices from the table in the **[Journal Sections](#Journal%20Sections)**. The only addition here is `W` which is just a blank template to add a different workout routine from the the usual arm/torso/leg.\n\n**Template Note:**\n```eta\n\u003c%* if (tp.file.title.match(/.*-WL-A/)) { -%\u003e\n\u003c% tp.file.include(\"[[Arm Day Template]]\") %\u003e\n\u003c%* } else if (tp.file.title.match(/.*-WL-T/)) { -%\u003e\n\u003c% tp.file.include(\"[[Torso Day Template]]\") %\u003e\n\u003c%* } else if (tp.file.title.match(/.*-WL-L/)) { -%\u003e\n\u003c% tp.file.include(\"[[Lower Body Day Template]]\") %\u003e\n\u003c%* } else if (tp.file.title.match(/.*-WL-W/)) { -%\u003e\n\u003c% tp.file.include(\"[[Workout Log Template]]\") %\u003e\n\u003c%* } else {} %\u003e\n```\n\nThis is the template that I have for quickadd to use when creating a note.

For ease, I've decided to immedately jump into my system and actually put the step of converting my Data from Notion to Obsidian at the end. The latter is far too long and would be too much to read through from the get go; you've come here for the system in Obsidian not the drudgery of converting files.\n\n\n---\n# System\n\n## Fields\nThe fields that go into an entry depend on the type of **[Medium](#Medium%20Pages)** it is. The fields are the same across the board so that when I query for the **[Current Page](#Current%20Page)** and avoiding adding every variation of that field name to cover my bases.\n\n\u003e Any fields specific to a medium are covered in the [Medium Pages](#Medium%20Pages) section.\n\n```yaml\nTitle: \nCreator: \n\nRating: \nLGBT:\n\nCategory: \nType: \nDescription: \nLink: \n\nProgress: \nCurrently: \n\nSeries: \nSeries Number: \nSeries Total: \n\nAdded: \nMedium: \nImage: \nFile: \n```\n\n---\n**File Titles** in this vault may have properties with the same name but are separate things entirely, so most files are formatted as:\n`Property Title -- Creator`. \n\n**Example:** `The Chronicles of Verraine -- Eleanor Konik`\n\n---\n\n**Title** is just the name given to the property. It used to be `Name` but `Title` is just much nicer to me for a database.\n\n---\n**Creator** includes those who wrote, drew, directed, etcetera that property. \n\nThis was one of those fields that had to be changed as it used to have different names depending on the medium (ie. Author, Director, DM, etc). Didn't want to have to keep track of them all, so *creator* is a good catch all for me.\n\n---\n**Rating** is my personal rating system on how much I liked what I just watched/read.\n\nMore on this rating system in the [Rating Tags](#Rating%20Tags) section.\n\n---\n**LGBT** is my personal \"rating\" system for how LGBT+ friendly/unfriendly a property is. More on this rating system in the [LGBT Ratings](#LGBT%20Ratings%20Tags) section.\n\nIt used to be `LGBT Rating` but Supercharged Links had trouble with recognizing the difference between this and the personal `Rating`. It would end up changing `Rating` as well if I set a value for `LGBT`, so `LGBT Rating` had to be changed.\n\n---\n**Category** is all the tags that belong to that property. More on this in the [Category Tags](#Category%20Tags) section.\n\n---\n**Description** is just a field for a text summary either from IMDB or my own if there aren't any summaries for it. Since these are inline properties, any paragraph breaks I use ` \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e ` so that it at least outputs correctly when in preview mode.\n\n---\n**Link** is just where a markdown link to a website where the property is hosted or just where it's sold/can be found from.\n\n---\n**Status/Progress** are both fields that track progress of a property. While they generally mean the same thing, in my system, there's a difference. More on this in the [Status/Progress Tags](#Status%20Progress%20Tags) section.\n\n---\n**Currently** is a field that I use to note to myself what part of the media I'm currently on. \n\nFor example: `Ch 4 Pg 3`, `S3 EP 4`, etc.\n\n---\n**Series** and all its \"sub\"-fields are ones that depend on the type of media and whether it has a high probability of having series. If it does, the series field is for the title of the series.\n\n**Series Number** is the place that entry is within the series. \n\nFor example: `Halo: Combat Evolved` is `1` in the `Halo` series.\n\n**Series Total** is the *total* number of entries a series has and will be manually updated if more come out.\n\nThe reason that this is *here* and not in a page for the *series* itself is just because I tend to look more at entries than I do for series since they're often complete and rarely ongoing.\n\n---\n**Added** is the date and time in ISO 8601 format for when I *add* that entry to the database, not when I found it or when I started watching it nor when I completed it.\n\nI find that I forget to record when I consumed that property or I'll have bookmarked it to add it into the MediaDB vault later. It would just be more stress for me to really dig into when I started or finished it, so personally I just focus on when I added it into the database and that's good enough for me.\n\n---\n**Medium** is the type of media the item is (ie. Literature, Comic, Movie, etc.). This is a field on *every* item page as it allows me to use the Supercharged Links plugin and assign an icon to that item based on whatever is in that field.\n\n**Image** is just a link to either the `![](]()` external image or the `![[]]` internal one in my vault. \n\n**File** is also a link to the external file or the internal one in my vault.\n\n## Links/Tags\nFor the tags of my MediaDB, I was *very* glad I'd been quite zealous on Notion and had a legend for what each of the tag types were and what they meant. Moving all of those over was a bit tedious but it got me thinking far more about how I wanted my tags to work; both visually and functionally.\n\n**Criteria:**\n- I will *always* want something that I can easily glance at and recognize what it means. (eg. Tag is blue --\u003e it's an Alternate Universe Tag)\n- That means I also need something that won't force me to squint or stop to read it. \n- If it takes *too* much effort to read what something says, I refuse to even bother giving it my time. It might seem harsh, but that's what I need; **readability is my top priority.**\n\n### Tags or Links?\nSo now the question was: **Do I use links or tags for my MediaDB Vault?**\n\n**Tags**\n- I was a big fan of regular tags for the ease of querying\n- I liked the fact that I could get a drop down of any related subtags if I typed the tag name\n- What I didn't like was how long my tags would be because of my system.\n- Being unable to use spaces was also something I wasn't a fan of.\n\n\u003e **Note:** My issues here *can* be fixed with css which I'll go over for tags in the **[Styling](#Styling)** section.\n\n**Links**\nI was already kind of leaning towards Links as my tags over regular tags.\n- I liked that links could have aliases so I wouldn't need to look at a lot of unnecessary text to read than what I needed to.\n- The option to hover over the links and see a note of the explanation of what that tag is in case I forget or am unsure was something I liked.\n- The final nail in the coffin to finally go all in was with the introduction of the Supercharged Links plugin to style the links based on the field value within it\n\n---\n**In the end I decided to go with Links.** The hover option to see filled pages for whatever I linked together was the main reason for this decision.\n\nThe way I structured the name of my links is similar to Nested Tags so that I could start typing `Cat-Uni-` and only see options for Universe Links.\n\n\n### Rating \"Tags\"\nThis was a rating \"system\" that I created when I was just starting to create my database *far* before even Notion came into the picture. \n\nThe reason I created it was because, to me, a number system just didn't feel personal enough, it was *too* objective so if I gave a property a score *lower* than 5 it would seem like I *really* didn't like it. This way, I could give a proper score without feeling like I was calling a good piece of work trash. These words give a better idea of my thoughts on it.\n\nIt's just kinda funny that it ended up lining up to being a `10` item list, so you *can* just think of it like a `10 Star Rating` and convert it to see what that looks like. I prefer this system since it's far more useful for me this way.\n\n**Example:** `[[Rating-Liked|Liked]]`\n\nRating | Description |\n---|---|\nLoved | Absolute and *immense adoration* of the work.\nLiked | The work is pretty *fantastic*.\nGood | The work is pretty great.\nNice | A pleasant time can be had.\nFine | Has plenty of good elements to it isn't amazing.\nOkay | Has *some* good elements but not enough.\nMeh | Felt indifferent about the work; not good, not terrible.\nNah | Mild dislike for the work.\nDisliked | Insufferable elements and somewhat of a bad time\nHated | Work is absolutely terrible and entirely insufferable.\n\n\u003e **‚ö† Note:** All of these ratings are my *personal* feelings, any measure of *objectivity* is **not** taken into account when using this. It's entirely on what I felt when consuming the work. So the work could be crafted exceptionally well *\"objectively\"*, but end up with a `Nah` rating.\n\n### LGBT+ Ratings \"Tags\"\n\u003e This is a personal field/tagging system for me to see where a property falls on it's execution of representation.\n\nThis was important for *me* as I personally feel more inclined to watch or rewatch a property that has a better LGBT Rating or to just prepare myself for the possible good or bad dynamics/events of these identities in that work if I've yet to see it.\n\n**Example:** `[[LGBT Rating-Queer Main|Queer Main]]`\n\nRating | Description |\n---|---|\nQueer Focused | Media that focuses on the experience of being LGBT+.\nOpenly Queer | Multiple LGBT+ characters or relationships that are clearly and explicitly stated to be LGBT+.\nQueer Main | LGBT+ main character within the media.\nQueer Side | LGBT+ side character within the media\nBury Your Gays Trope | LGBT+ character is killed off.\nConvenient Breakup | LGBT+ relationship where the characters break up, often for nonsensical reasons, to easily get rid of the relationship in that media.\nToxic Relationship | LGBT+ relationship is shown, but has a toxic/unhealthy dynamic.\nRelationship Subtext | LGBT+ relationship is implied to exist, but is not explicitly confirmed or denied within the media.\nToken LGBT+ | LGBT+ character introduced only to add diversity to the cast or media.\nConfirmed Off-Screen | Relationship(s) or character(s) confirmed to be LGBT+ but said LGBT+ status not shown in their media.\nSexual Tension | There is a tension between two characters (who may or may not be LGBT+) implying a possible relationship, but never ending up in a relationship.\nStraight Passing | There may be LGBT+ character(s), but it's easily deniable that it is the case.\nQueerbait | The sexuality of character(s) or potential relationship are teased to be LGBT+ but are never confirmed to increase views.\nLGBT+ In Background | There are LGBT+ characters/relationships but only in the background.\nNo LGBT+ | No LGBT+ characters/relationships.\n\n\n### Medium \"Tags\"\n\n**Example:** `[[Medium-Show|Show]]`\n\nMedium | |\n---|---|\n`Show` | TV, YouTube Shows, etc\n`Movie` | Standard hour \u0026 30 min, Short Films, Film Series/Universes, etc\n`Literature` | Books (Physical/Digital), Web Stories, etc\n`Comic` | Graphic Novels, Mangas, Web Comics, etc\n`Game` | PC, Console, Mobile, Board Games, Table Top Games, etc\n\n---\n**Type**\nTypes in this case are subtypes of any of the `Medium` tags.\n\n**Example:** `[[Type-Video Game|Video Game]]`\n\nTypes ||\n---|---|\n`Live Action` | Property involves actual people.\n`Animated` | Property involves artistic renditions of the world.\u003cbr\u003e(2D, 3D, Stopmotion, etc)\n||\n`Fanfiction` | Works using characters from another property\n`Manga`/`Manhwa`/etc | Comics that are from different countries\n`Web Comic` | Comics that are primarily or only distributed on the internet\n||\n`Video Game` | Digital game\n`Table Top` | Game's usually geared to 'around the table' play\n`Let's Play` | Youtube/twitch series where creators are playing a game\n||\n`Non-Fiction` | Not about fictional events, characters, etc\n`Fiction` | About fictional events, characters, etc\n\n\n### Category \"Tags\"\n**Example:** `[[Cat-Rel-Childhood Friends|Childhood Friends]]`\n\nCategory | Link Prefix | Example\n---|---|---|\nUniverse | `Cat-Uni-` | Zombie Apocalypse\nRelationship | `Cat-Rel-` | Childhood Friends\nEmotion | `Cat-Emo-` | Horror\nWarning | `Cat-Warn-` | Unbalanced Power Dynamics\nWholesomeness | `Cat-Whol-` | Problematic\nExtras | `Cat-Ex-` | Society\n\n### Status/Progress \"Tags\"\nWhile generally these *mean* the same thing, in my database, they're slightly different. The reason I separated them is because while a property can be *completed* (maybe even finished years ago), I'm currently in the process of watching it. I needed some way to be able to tell which pieces of media might already be completed, but I'm still reading and haven't personally finished, *and* which property I have read as far as I can but it's still got more content planned to come out later.\n\n---\n\n**Status** is for the status of the *property* itself. So if a show is on hiatus it will receive a `[[Status-Hiatus|Hiatus]]` link/tag. \n\n**Progress** is for *my personal* progress on a piece of media. If I'm still watching a show it'll receive a `[[Progress-In Progress|In Progress]]` link/tag.\n\n**Example:**\n- `[[Status-Cancelled|Cancelled]]`\n- `[[Progress-Dropped|Dropped]]`\n\nStatus/Progress | |\n---|---| \n`Queued` | Planned to start, but hasn't\n`In Progress` | Currently working through\n`Hiatus` | Started, but then paused\n`Cancelled`/`Dropped` | Started, but stopped and will no longer work through | Progress version of `Cancelled`\n`Complete` | Started and finished the work\n\n\n## Images\n\u003e The dilemma: internally linked images or externally linked images?\n\nEven though I have images in some of my pages, I've avoided pulling them up with dataview for now because I'm still undecided over whether or not I want to use external images.\n\n**Internally linked images** are my go to for ensuring that the images that I do display are always available and, but unfortunately internally linked images don't display in dataview, so my saved images can't be pulled up. There's also the possibility of just having so many images that the vault grows *too* large for Obsidian Sync's 4gb limit or the limit for Dropbox's 2gb and Onedrive's 5gb limits.\n\n**Externally linked images** are ones that *do* work with dataview, but some of my links are definitely broken for some notes. I don't want to deal with images disappearing whenever I'm not connected to the internet either even if I go with the option of using imgur or anything similar.\n\n---\n\u003e For now, I've just decided that I would use either one whenever I'm adding data to my pages, but not even bother trying to show them in the dataview query.\n\nExternally linked images are for media that I don't care all that much about but still want an image for while Internally linked images are for media that I really enjoy and want a concrete image that won't disappear when a site goes down.\n\n# The MediaDB Vault\n## Workspace\nI'm using the **Tangerine Dunes** CSS Snippets color scheme which was inspired by the color from my HQ Vault folder for my Databases which was an orange-red color. I just needed a different color scheme so that I quickly knew which vault I was in from any of the rest that may be open at the same time.\n\n\u003e As far as how I layout my vault, it's pretty simple and I try to keep the things that I search through often all laid out in front of me.\n\n[![|sban](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-MediaDB_Workspace.png)](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-MediaDB_Workspace.png) *My general layout for the vault.*\n\n\n**Left Sidebar** has the `Search` at the top so that I can easily query for something within my vault. Below that is the `File Explorer` so that I can browse through some of the files in my setup if I need to fix something, mostly I need to open either the `00 Technical` or the `10 Meta` folders quite often.\n\n**Middle Panes** are separated but linked and allow me to easily type in the edit pane and see the changes made to preview mode. I don't tend need more than 1 media page open at a time so this simple 2 pane setup is more than enough.\n\n**Right Sidebar** at the top has my **Starred** pages, but I tend to look through the `File Explorer` more often for those same pages mostly out of habit than efficiency... but it's still there so I can *try* to use that instead. Below that is the [Medium Pages](#Medium%20Pages) with all my queries for `Currently`, `Recently Added`, and `Queue` pages so that they're easily always accessible and don't interfere with my Middle Panes.\n\n## Folder Structure\n\n- **00 Technical**\n\t- 0 Templates\n\t- 1 Images\n\t\t- Covers\n\t\t- Fandom\n\t\t- Media\n\t- 2 Files\n\t- 5 Workbench\n- **10 Meta**\n\t- 0 Tag\n\t- 1 Medium\n\t- 2 Fandoms\n- **Fanfiction**\n- **Games**\n- **Let's Plays**\n- **Movies**\n- **Shows**\n\n### 00 Technical\n\n**Templates** contains all my template files for *every* kind of file: Media Pages, Queries, Meta Pages, etc.\n\n---\n**Images** contains all images used within the vault. \n\n**Media** are the images that I link to in the `Image::` field for my Media pages.\n\n**Fandom** are the images for each of the fandoms in the Fanfiction Medium page.\n\n**Cover** is the same as the Media images folder, but these are images that **I** created *for* specific Media pages.\n\n---\n**Files** is the folder where I store pdfs/markdown files of the Media pages that I link to in the `File::` field.\n\n**Workbench** is just a folder of files where I test out plugins or queries.\n\n### 10 Meta\n\n**0 Tags** contains all the explanation pages for *every* tag. It also contains pages that the Supercharged Link plugin uses to allow me to select my tags when I [add Media pages](#Adding%20Pages).\n\n---\n**1 Medium** contains notes with the main queries that I use to list out all the media within the Media folders. The files are named similarly to the folders.\n\n---\n**2 Fandoms** contain notes with the queries for specific fandoms for the Fanfiction folder's files. \n\nFile Title: `Fandom-Fandom Name`\n\nIf there are crossovers the file will be titled: `Crossover-Fandom1 - Fandom2`\n\n**Example:** `Crossover-Wonder Woman - Tomb Raider`\n\n### Media Folders\n\nThe rest of the folders in the list are where all the Media Pages are stored into their own sections. There are no sub folders to separate them, it's all a flat structure for the rest of the folders.\n\n\n## Medium Pages\nMost of these pages are just full of dataview queries, but the ones that I do include here are ones with either notable formatting or useful dataview queries. There is also some use of the Obsidian Query Language to generate the total number of files related to that note.\n\n[![|sban](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-MediaDB_Medium-DnD-Lets-Play.png)](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-MediaDB_Medium-DnD-Lets-Play.png) *Example of general page format/styling*\n\n#### Fanfiction\n\u003e Homepage for my queries and Fandoms structured in a way that's useful for me.\n\n[![|sban](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-MediaDB_Medium-Fanfiction.gif)](/0_Technical/1_Images/Setup-MediaDB_Medium-Fanfiction.gif) *Gif of the Fanfiction Medium Homepage*\n\nThe page contains a general **Count** of the amount of files within the Fanfiction folder at the top using the Obsidian Query Language plugin.\n\n---\nThere's a **Recently Added** section that lists the files I've added to the MediaDB vault along with a subheading that has my raindrop.io **Media Inbox** iframed into it. \n\nMore information on this in the [Media Inbox](#Media%20Inbox) section\n\n---\nThe **Fandom** section is where I manually list out the fandoms within the Fanfiction folder so that I can easily go into each and find whatever I currently want. The reason I manually sort it instead of letting Dataview do it for me is that I personally want to sort which ones I'm currently interested in at the top and least interested in at the bottom.

I just exported to CSVs and I was pretty much set. Later on, I also exported to HTML because that option also takes any of the photos I had inside Notions database pages with it. Saved me the pain of trying to reopen every single item and copying/saving every photo to transfer it over.\n\nI used @koala's [**CSV to Markdown python script**](https://github.com/kometenstaub/csv-to-md) to convert my CSVs into markdown. The script creates a new MD file *per* row/item in your CSVs. It's really fast and the options to specify how each field's value is formatted made it fantastic and painless to convert things.\n\nI opted to export it in dataview's inline field syntax `::` over YAML specifically so that I could link entries to each other and actually have Obsidian recognize those connections. YAML currently doesn't support that, nor does it support wiki link syntax very well, so inline fields was my choice to organize my data.\n\n## Adjusting The Data For My New System\nNow this step in the process was the *longest* and most challenging part for me to go through. This was something I had been working on/brainstorming for a long while. \n\nWithin Obsidian, I had Mermaid Charts to help me plan what kind of information should go into them, where, and *why* should that be there. What types of fields I decided to include or omit will be covered in more detail later, but for now the heavy focus was on designing my tagging system.\n\n## Restructuring\n\u003e A lot of the information that I had exported into a markdown file needed heavy editing to match the system I wanted to use.\n\nIt *probably* wouldn't have taken me as long if I had known how powerful VScode search and replace regex *allowed* for storing strings among other things üòÖ. Here will be all the regex that I used during this process if you find you might need it. \n\n### Date/Time\nA lot of the dates that Notion output weren't in ISO format so I used this regex to grab and change the date to ISO format.\n\n**Search:**\n```regex\nJan, (\\d{2}), (\\d{4})\n```\n- `Jan, ` find any text that has Jan with a comma and a space\n- `(\\d{2}), ` capture/save the text that has 2 consecutive digits, then continue searching past the comma and space\n- `(\\d{4})` capture and save the text that has 4 consecutive digits\n\n**Replace:**\n```regex\n$2-01-$1\n```\n- Put the year first, which is the second group: `(\\d{4})`\n- Replace Jan with `01` (this has to be manual for the months)\n- Put the day at the end which is the first group `(\\d{2})`\n\n**Input:** `Jan, 17, 2021`\n**Output:** `2021-01-17`\n\n### Links\nCSV to Markdown exported all my tags and changed my categories and other field values to wikilinks, but they didn't have the prefixing that I decided on from the [Tags or Links](#Tags%20or%20Links) section, so now was time for painful search and replace.\n\nAdding the prefixes for my [Category Tags](#Category%20Tags) unfortunately had no regex way to quickly automate that for me, so I had to search and replace those manually.\n\nAdding the **aliases** to the end of those changed links was far easier for links where I might've just forgotten to add some.\n\n**Search:**\n```regex\n(\\[\\[)(.*) - (.*) - (.*)(\\]\\])\n```\n- `(\\[\\[)` Capture the brackets into it's own group \n- `(.*)` Capture any text between the ` - ` and do this 3 times\n- `(\\]\\])` Capture the brackets into its own group\n\n**Replace:**\n```regex\n$1Ship-$2 - $3 - $4|$2/$3/$4$5\n```\n- `$1` place brackets back `[[`\n- `Ship-` add text\n- `$2`, `$3`, `$4` Add capture groups back\n- `$5` place brackets back `]]`\n\n**Input:** `[[Ship-Trevor - Alucard - Sypha]]`\n**Output:** `[[Ship-Trevor - Alucard - Sypha|Trevor/Alucard/Sypha]]`\n\n### Fields\n#### Adding\nI realized I needed a way to list out what *type* of media this note about what I consumed actually was. It wasn't a field in my original CSV and it didn't seem like VSCode could add a line at a specific number. So what I did instead was find the title of the field I wanted to add *before* that field and squeeze it in there.\n\n**Search:**\n```regex\n(Added:: .*)\n```\n- `Added:: .*` grab the entire line that has `Added::` in it\n- `()` tells regex to capture whatever is inside as a group, so the entire line is saved\n\n---\n**Replace:**\n```regex\n$1\\nMedium:: [[Medium-Movie|Movie]]\n```\n\n- `$1` puts the group back, so all of `Added::` is put back\n- `\\n` adds a new line\n- `Medium:: [[Medium-Movie|Movie]]` add all of this *after* everything else\n\n#### Find Notes With Only This Tag, But Add/Change A Different Field\nI reach a point where I realized I needed to add a new property to some pages, but the flat structure really made this incredibly difficult. I *did not* want to have to manually go into every note and add the new field and its values, especially since I had about 300+ files to go through.\n\nA *lot* of trial and error and pushing the limits of my own regex knowledge finally allowed me to do exactly what I wanted.\n\n**Search:**\n```regex\nFandom:: \\[\\[Fandom-(.*)\\]\\]\n((.*\\n){1,})\n?Property:: \n```\n- `Fandom:: \\[\\[Fandom-` Find this line and this text in it\n- `(.*)\\]\\]` save everything that comes before the closing brackets into a group\n- `((.*\\n){1,})` Copy every line in between into a group\n- `?Property:: ` Stop at Property line\n\n**Replace:**\n```.\nFandom:: [[Fandom-$1]]\n$2Property:: [[$1]]\n```\n\n- `Fandom:: [[Fandom-$1]]` put back the whole first line\n- `$2` put back all of the lines in between\n- `Property:: [[$1]]` add the new value/change to the property.\n\n---\n# Fin\nI believe I covered nearly everything within my MediaDB Vault, but if there's anything that I may have glossed over that you'd like to know more about, don't hesitate to leave a question! I'm happy to answer and explain anything I missed in more detail if need be.\n\nAny thoughts and suggestions are welcome as well! I'm still working this system out myself so things may change slightly as time goes on, but the fundamentals laid out here might stay the same.","lastmodified":"2022-11-19T16:06:07.307520584Z","tags":null},"/SlRvb":{"title":"SlRvb","content":"\nHello!
