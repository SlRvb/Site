# SlRvb
> Hello! I'm the creator of the [ITS Theme](3_Nebula/ITS-Theme/ITST--ITS-Theme.md) and all it's [related snippets](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme#guidereference). 

If you want to learn more and find all my stuff across the web, visit my [About Me page](SlRvb.md).

This is my *stable* website. When my Obsidian publish site goes down, this one will still be up. It's more work to maintain, so it won't be updated as quickly with my current workflow, but it will be the most stable especially link-wise.
