These are the written works of fiction within the *[In The Shadows Universe](1_ITS/ITS--In-The-Shadows.md)*. Each story is set in an alternate universe from the lore that [In The Shadows](1_ITS/Stories/ITS-Story--In-The-Shadows.md) established as the *original* lore of the universe.

# Original Property
Stories whose concepts were created entirely by [SlRvb](SlRvb.md). Characters, locations, and the lore of the [In The Shadows Universe](1_ITS/ITS--In-The-Shadows.md) are present and often altered within each of the works.

- [[ITS-Story--The-Angel-And-The-Witch]]
- [[ITS-Story--Bi-Bar-Of-Lonely-Hearts]]
- [[ITS-Story--Pulse]]
- [[ITS-Story--In-The-Shadows]]

# Property Inspired
Stories whose concepts were borrowed from or inspired by properties. (All of which belong to their respective owners). Most of these stories generally only follow the most basic idea of the properties and have their lore reworked to fit into the [In The Shadows Universe](1_ITS/ITS--In-The-Shadows.md).

The stories listed below never feature any of the characters and may only have some lore inserted from within the original property. Only the characters, lore, locations within the *[In The Shadows Universe](1_ITS/ITS--In-The-Shadows.md)* are present.
